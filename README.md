# Final Project Proposal
# Title: Detection and localization of cracks and other distresses inside sewer pipelines using deep neural network 
## Team Members: Srinath Shiv Kumar and Tarutal Ghosh Mondal

### Motivation
    Lack of adequate and timely maintainance of sewer pipelines leads to several hazards such as cracks, leakage, deleterious deposits, infiltration of tree roots etc., inflicting a huge cost of repair and retrofit. This calls for regular inspection of sewer pipeline systems. The prevalent inspection techniques in US are mainly manual which make them expensive, time consuming, subjective and inaccurate. Therefore, autonomous inspection techniques are gradually becoming popular owing to their speed, accuracy and economic viability. 

### Goals
    This work will focus on detection and localization of cracks and other distresses inside sewer pipe systems from CCTV images. Deep neural network based object detection algorithms such as Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, YOLO 9000 will be exploited to this end. 
    
### Challenges 
    * Available dataset (in form of images and videos) is small 
    * Image and video quality is not up to the mark
